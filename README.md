# sketch-txt-2-img

Sketch plugin to replace selected texts or shapes with images from various APIs

# Usage

- Write some text / name your shape layer
- Hit the shortcut ```⌘``` + ```⌥``` + ```g```

The fine print: in the Plugins > txt2img > Settings you can choose a different source for the icons / images.
It should be easy enough to add some more...
