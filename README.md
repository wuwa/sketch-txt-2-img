> The fine print:
> - Select as many layers as you wish to. If a text layer - it will be substituted with an image. If a shape layer - the shape will be filled with the image. If a group - nothing will happen...
> - Works with single words or more. It really gets interesting when writing longer sentences.
> - Works with SVG or BMP sources.
> - Plugins > txt2img > Settings you can choose a different source for the icons / images. It should be easy enough to add some more...
> - Hit the command again and again and you will get a different image every time (almost).
